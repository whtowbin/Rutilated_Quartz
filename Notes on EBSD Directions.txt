EBSD Directions

Quotes from code I wrote a few years ago on this:

"""
    x = np.sin(np.deg2rad(theta)) # this configuration has the x axis oriented to the north  (in OIM A1 axis)
    y = -np.cos(np.deg2rad(theta)) # (in OIM A2 axis)This has a negative sign because our SEM is oriented left to right. I may need to change this if the Euler angles dont represent the orientation corrected 
    z = 0.0 #(in OIM A3 axis)
"""

A1- X North-South Axis X vector positive in the North 
A2- Y East-West Axis This is positive in the West direction due to how our configuration of the EBSD is set up
A3- Z axis is the up down axis.
